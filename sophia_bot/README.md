Sophia is a bot project for customer service on telegram, 
it is already functional, but still needs refinements and other features.
Feel free to contribute to the initial project.

The purpose of this bot is to provide automated responses to common questions, 
perform moderation of inappropriate messages, and interact with users through messages 
in chats or groups. It uses a list of predefined answers to respond to questions, 
offers moderation of improper words, and can interact in both private chats and groups.
